"""
1. Write a function that sums two number.
2. Write a function that divides two numbers,
   but doesn't return a floating point value.
3. Write a function that sums a whole array of numbers.
4. Write a function that prints the even numbers from a given list.

---
Please note that:
1. Your functions should handle cases in which you don't
expect the same data type. In other words, 
your first function should fail if you tried to sum two strings.

2. Your test cases should cover every case you can think off.
